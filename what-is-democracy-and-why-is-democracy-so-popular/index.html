    <h1>What is democracy and why is democracy so popular?</h1>
    <p>Written by Namish Kumar</p>
    <p>Home or Market, School or Office no matter wherever you live, we require freedom. Imagine you are in your school or in your office but your staff/teacher does not allow you to take lunch/tiffin. How would you feel? Similar is with democracy. India is a democratic country. USA is also a well-known democratic country. In fact Abraham lincoln, the 16th president of the US has described democracy as the government of the people, for the people and by the people. So, If people don't enjoy freedom or independence then democracy is meaningless! We all are human beings. In fact a small bird is always sad when it can't fly in the sky freely. The caged bird needs freedom and independence. Hence, Freedom can be compared to a caged bird.</p>

    <h1>Democracy vs Autocracy/Monarchy</h1>
    <p>Now a crucial question comes. How is democracy useful? How is democracy better than other forms of government? Well, Democracy is the government for the people, of the people and by the people. So that means a democratic government is formed by its citizens. It is of the people, which means the government is made for the citizens. In India, Every citizen of India having attained an age of 18 years or more can vote in elections. He/She is given a Voter ID/Card. This is called Universal Adult Franchise according to the Indian Constitution.</p>
    <p>Moreover, Every democratic country has own set of its guidelined known as a Constitution. Similarly, India also has a Constitution, but in written form. You will be amazed to know that the Constitution of Britain is not available in written form.</p>

    <p>Now question comes regarding the popularity of democracy. Why do you thing is democracy so popular? It is because of the following reasons:-</p>
    <ul style="line-gap-override: 5px;">

        <li>People have the freedom of speech</li>
        <li>People have the freedom of residing anywhere within the country</li>
        <li>People and children have the right to education</li>
